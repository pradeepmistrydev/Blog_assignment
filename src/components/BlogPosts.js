                <p className='mt-3 border-bottom pb-3'>This blog post shows a few different types of content that’s supported and styled with Bootstrap. Basic typography, lists, tables, images, code, and more are all supported as expected.</p>
                <p className='pt-2'>Cum Nor again is <button className='btn_link'> there anyone who loves or pursues</button> or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.</p>

                <p className='pt-2'> To take a <b>trivial example</b>, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it. </p>

                <p className='pt-2'> Rick and Morty has shown the world that cartoons for adults can have a different take on humor than the Simpsons – and still be a massive success. </p>

                <h4 className='pt-4 font_playfair'>Heading</h4>
                <p className='pt-2'>A big reason why the show has enjoyed so much success is one of the main characters: drunken genius grandfather who travels across dimensions and is skeptical of everything. He’s the big selling point of the show, and he could also breathe new life into your design. </p>

                <p className='pt-2'>Pirate Ipsum: walk the plank </p>
                <p className='pt-2'>Cupcake Ipsum is all about keeping things sweet. This Lorem Ipsum alternative mentions endless baking and cooking terms that go on for as long as we need it to. </p>


                <h5 className='pt-4 font_playfair'>Sub-Heading</h5>
                <p className='pt-2'>Desserts and sweets aren’t for everyone – but who doesn’t like cheese? Cheese Ipsum goes for a similar effect to Cupcake Ipsum, but focusing on all the different types and shapes of cheese out there. Mozzarella, anyone? </p>

                <ul className='mx-3 mt-2'>
                    <li>It’s true that while quite similar to classic Lorem Ipsum, this</li>
                    <li>Vibe that comes from using words like “de carne lumbering animata corpora quaeritis</li>
                    <li>With that said, we still love this option because of how subtle it is compared to some of the other Lorem Ipsum alternatives.</li>
                </ul>

                <p className='pt-3' >It certainly would make the prototype feel younger and more casual than good old Latin.</p>

                <ol className='mx-3 mt-3'>
